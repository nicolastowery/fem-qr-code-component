## My process

### Built with

- Frontend Mentor provided colors
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was my first Frontend Mentor Project. I do not have access to the design files so everything was eyeballed and therefore is not pixel perfect. I did not bother to convert my units to rem, although this would be best.
